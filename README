# Protocol
---

The concept behind the bitflood protocol is similar to BitTorrent in that files are divided into
chunks with associated hashes and traded between peers.  However, with bitflood, each chunk can
be assigned a priority which can help to influence how urgently it is sought by the client.  In
theory, this should allow for using p2p distribution for streaming.

The code is quite old and has little documentation.  There are a handful of reference
implementations.

Things that would be good directions for work:

- Support a JSON torrent file format
- Write some more modern reference implementations
