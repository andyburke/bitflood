A method of transferring data in a distributed environment that is nothindered by scaling upwards.  Data files shall be separated intovaried lengths called data segments.  These segments shall bescheduled for transfer at differentiating periods in order to mitigateperformance.  A distributed environment is defined as a set of nodeseach in possession of some set of data segments that may or may notoverlap. There will be an initial node whom shall always have acomplete set of data segments.  The transfer of data segments fromnodes with possession of a data segment to nodes without possession ofa data segment shall be determined by a tracker.  A tracker willestablish communication with all nodes in the distributed environmentand coordinate data segment transfers based upon requests by the nodesfor segments not in said nodes possession.
