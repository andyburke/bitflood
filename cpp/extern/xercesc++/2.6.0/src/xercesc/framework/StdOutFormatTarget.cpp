 *
 * Revision 1.9  2004/02/09 23:01:43  peiyongz
 * Bug#20684: patch from carbe771@student.liu.se (C-J Berg)
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2004/01/29 11:46:29  cargilld
 * Code cleanup changes to get rid of various compiler diagnostic messages.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2003/05/29 11:18:37  gareth
 * Added macros in so we can determine whether to do things like iostream as opposed to iostream.h and whether to use std:: or not.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2003/01/24 20:20:22  tng
 * Add method flush to XMLFormatTarget
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2003/01/09 18:58:29  tng
 * [Bug 15427] DOMWriter dose not flush the output stream.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2002/11/22 14:25:59  tng
 * Got a number of compilation erros for those non-ANSI C++ compliant compiler like xlC v3.
 * Since the previous fix is just for fixing a "warning", I think it doesn't worth to break users who
 * are not ANSI C++ ready yet.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2002/11/21 15:45:34  gareth
 * gcc 3.2 now issues a warning for use of iostream.h. Removed the .h and prefixed cout with std::.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/11/04 15:00:21  tng
 * C++ Namespace Support.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2002/05/28 22:40:46  peiyongz
 * DOM3 Save Interface: DOMWriter/DOMWriterFilter
